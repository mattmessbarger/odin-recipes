        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) boneless rib-eye steaks </li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li>pinch garlic powder, or to taste </li>
            <li>pinch Montreal steak seasoning, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Place steaks in a flat baking dish or container. Cut slits at 1-inch intervals in the fat around the edges of the steaks. Gently pierce both sides of each steak a few times with a fork.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle each steak with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Montreal steak seasoning. Pat seasonings into steaks.</li>
            <li>Whisk olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, garlic, and liquid smoke together in a bowl. Pour marinade over steaks to coat. Cover container or baking dish with plastic wrap and marinate steaks in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Turn steaks over and marinate for another 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Cook the steaks on the preheated grill until they start to firm, and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).</li>
